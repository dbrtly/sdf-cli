## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to configure environment variables and secrets in our cloud platform. By adding these, you can securely manage sensitive data and environment-specific configurations.

<Warning>
If you do not set an environment in your `.sdf.yml` file, the environment will default to `dbg`.If you want to change the default, you will need to update your `.sdf.yml` workspace block. To learn more, [see our doc on Renaming & Environments](/guide/setup/environments).

    <Step title="Save the Configuration and Recompile">
        - Click the check mark to save the environment variable or secret. If you want to add more, click 'Add More' and repeat the steps.
        <Tip>
        After adding environment variables and secrets, you may need to recompile your workspace to see the changes reflected. To do this, [navigate to the top of your workspace page](https://console.sdf.com/catalog/settings) and select "Recompile".

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Required Fields:** Ensure all required fields are filled in correctly.
- **Environment Variable/Secret Not Saving:** Check for any error messages and ensure all fields are correctly filled.
- **Workspace Failed to Compile:** [Check the logs for your workspace](https://console.sdf.com/catalog/logs/default) to find more extensive information on why compilation failed. If your workspace fails to compile and youâ€™ve integrated with Github, you may need to re-sync with Github or recompile your workspace first.
