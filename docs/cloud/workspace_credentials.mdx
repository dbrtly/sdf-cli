## Overview

As an SDF Cloud administrator, AWS and Snowflake credentials can be set within the console settings.

Before you can set your credentials on the SDF Cloud, you'll first need to authenticate with the platform and have a workspace 
available or pushed to the cloud. 

<Note>
The SDF Cloud is only available via the **Plus** and above plans at this time. If you'd like to get access, please [inquire](https://sdf.com/inquiries)
