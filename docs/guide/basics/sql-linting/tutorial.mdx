In SQL development, ensuring code quality extends beyond syntax errors to include semantic issues and 
performance concerns. SDF's linter provides high performance and deep analysis.

This guided example will walk you through how SDF identifies syntax errors
and even optimizes query performance, helping you elevate your SQL code quality and uniformity. 

The best way to learn is by doing! Let's get started.

#### Prerequisite
- An up-to-date installation of SDF on your machine. Follow the [official guide](/introduction/install).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Sample Workspace">
    To create a sample linter workspace, run the following command:
    ```shell
      sdf new --sample linter && cd linter
    ```

    This will create an SDF sample workspace in your current directory. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Workspace">
    This workspace consists of two main components, a linter configuration and a model.

    The linter configuration lives in the `workspace.sdf.yml` and is defined in a `linter` config block:

    ```yml workspace.sdf.yml
    ---
    linter:
      name: custom_linter_config
      syntax-rules:
        ...
      ...
    ```

    To override the default linter configuration, we need to specify this config as default:
    ```yml workspace.sdf.yml
    workspace:
      ...
      defaults:
        dialect: snowflake
        linter: custom_linter_config  # this is the name we gave our linter config
        ...
    ```
    
    The model's path is `models/main.sql`, and it looks like this:
    ```sql models/main.sql
select 
    DISTINCT('Hello World!') AS message,
    num / 100.0 AS "num%", 
    num AS "NUM", 
    my_table.cool_col
FROM my_table
WHERE bool_col = 'TRUE'
ORDER BY 1, cool_col
; 
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run `sdf lint`">
    Let's start using the linter!

    In the current config, all rules are turned off. If we run `sdf lint`, we shouldn't get any warnings:
    ```shell
<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">

</div>
    ```

    Now, let's turn on a rule. In the `linter` config block, update the `flag-distinct-parenthesis` rule configuration:
    ```yml workspace.sdf.yml
    ---
    linter:
      name: custom_linter_config
      syntax-rules:
        flag-distinct-parenthesis: on 
      ...
    ```



    Try it out! Run `sdf lint` in your command line. The result should look like this:

    If your primary editor is VS Code, you can always click on an error to be taken to the right location.
      - `command + click` the file name to get to the exact location of the error
      - `command + click` the link to see the rule's documentation


    <Tip>
    To lint our model, we can run `sdf lint models/main.sql`, or `sdf lint` to have the linter review all files listed in the includes. In this case,
    we only have one model, so both will yield the same result.
    </Tip>

    
    Try playing with the rest of these rules by turning them on and off:
    
    ```yml
    # options: consistent, upper, lower, pascal, snake, camel
    case-keyword: upper  

    # options: on
    flag-inconsistent-ordinal-column-reference: on

    # options: on
    flag-trailing-semicolon-after-statements: on

    # options: default pattern ".#%{}\\<>*?/$!'\":@+`|=" 
    disallow-these-chars-in-quoted-identifiers: "%"

    # options: on
    flag-unnecessary-quoted-identifiers: on 

    # options: consistent, qualified, unqualified
    flag-inconsistent-qualified-column-reference: consistent

    # options: on
    flag-distinct-parenthesis: on 
    ```

    <Tip>
      To complete this guide, we recommend all above rules will be turned on.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix Some Issues">
    First, let's use SDF's automated fixing mechanism to clean some of the warnings.

    Simply run `sdf lint --fix` to fix all **casing warnings** automatically.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```sql before fix
select 
    DISTINCT('Hello World!') AS message,
    num / 100.0 AS "num%", 
    num AS "NUM", 
    my_table.cool_col
FROM my_table
WHERE bool_col = 'TRUE'
ORDER BY 1, cool_col
; 
      ```
<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
Working&nbsp;set&nbsp;1&nbsp;model&nbsp;file,&nbsp;1&nbsp;seed&nbsp;file,&nbsp;1&nbsp;.sdf&nbsp;file
&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling&nbsp;linter.pub.main&nbsp;(./models/main.sql)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished&nbsp;2&nbsp;models&nbsp;[2&nbsp;succeeded]&nbsp;in&nbsp;0.831&nbsp;secs

</code>
</pre>
</div>
      ```sql after fix
SELECT 
    DISTINCT('Hello World!') AS message,
    num / 100.0 AS "num%", 
    num AS "NUM", 
    my_table.cool_col
FROM my_table
WHERE bool_col = 'TRUE'
ORDER BY 1, cool_col
; 
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Now, we only have a couple of warnings left:
<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
warning: SDF111: Last statement must NOT end with a semicolon. See https://docs.sdf.com/reference/lint-rules#sdf111
  --> models/main.sql:8:20

warning: SDF123: DISTINCT is used with parentheses. See https://docs.sdf.com/reference/lint-rules#sdf123
  --> models/main.sql:2:5

warning: SDF117: Invalid character '%' in identifier. See https://docs.sdf.com/reference/lint-rules#sdf117
  --> models/main.sql:3:20

warning: SDF118: Unnecessary quoting of identifier 'NUM'. See https://docs.sdf.com/reference/lint-rules#sdf118
  --> models/main.sql:4:12

warning: SDF112: Column inconsistently referenced with and without a qualifier ('num', 'my_table.cool_col'). See https://docs.sdf.com/reference/lint-rules#sdf112
  --> models/main.sql:5:5

warning: SDF105: Mixing ordinal and non-ordinal sort item is not allowed. See https://docs.sdf.com/reference/lint-rules#sdf105
  --> models/main.sql:8:13

</code>
</pre>
</div>

    Try using our documentation to resolve the rest of the warnings, one by one. Alternatively, just copy the fixed query below:


    ```sql models/main.sql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT 'Hello World!' AS message, -- removed parentheses
    num / 100.0 AS "num_percentage", -- removed `%` from identifier `num%`
    num AS NUM, -- unquoted identifier
    cool_col, -- removed the `my_table` qualifier in the column reference my_table.cool_col
    NULL AS null_col, 
    TRUE AS true_col
FROM my_table
WHERE bool_col = 'TRUE'
ORDER BY message, cool_col -- removed ordinal reference 1 in `ORDER BY 1, cool_col`
-- removed ;

    ```

    If we check again, all lint rules should be resolved!
<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-error'>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished&nbsp;2&nbsp;models&nbsp;[1&nbsp;succeeded,&nbsp;1&nbsp;reused]&nbsp;in&nbsp;0.840&nbsp;secs

</div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Semantic Rules">
    These rules are unique to SDF and are only possible thanks to SDF's one-of-a-kind capability to compile your entire DAG, 
    including dependencies and data types. This unique capability allows us to deliver advanced rules tailored to 
    the context, semantics, and dependencies of *your* SQL which other linters simply cannot.

    For example, in the rule `disallow-implicit-conversions-in`, we detect that two sides of an equality condition are not 
    of the same datatype. Snowflake allows the flexibility and will implicitly convert on datatype to another, but the results 
    is confusing and can lead to logical issues that are almost impossible to detect!

    Let's see it in action. Update the configuration of the semantic rule `disallow-implicit-conversions-in` in the `linter` 
    config block in your `workspace.sdf.yml`:

    ```yml workspace.sdf.yml
    ---
    linter:
      name: custom_linter_config
      semantic-rules:
        disallow-implicit-conversions-in: [eq, in]  # changed from null
        ...
    ```

    Now, when we lint the file, first SDF will automatically compile the file, extracting context on data types and semantics. 
    It can detect that `bool_col` is a `BOOLEAN`, while `'TRUE'` is a `VARCHAR`, and what happens in Snowflake under the hood is:
    ```sql
    -- implicitly means: bool_col = CAST('TRUE' AS BOOLEAN)
     bool_col = 'TRUE' -- returns: True
    ```

    This relation doesn't go both ways - 
    ```sql
    -- implicitly means: 'TRUE' = CAST(bool_col AS VARCHAR)
    'TRUE' = bool_col -- returns: False 
    ```

    Confused? So were we! That's why we set up this semantic guardrail.

    <Tip>
      Semantic rules rely on SDF's ability to compile so they are turned off by default.

    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Default Settings">
    Our linter comes with [default configuration](/reference/lint-rules#default-configuration). To enable it, just remove the reference to our custom configuration in the 
    `defaults` section of the `workspace.sdf.yml`: 
        ```yml workspace.sdf.yml
    workspace:
      ...
      defaults:
        dialect: snowflake
        # linter: custom_linter_config  # remove this to use the default linter
        ...
    ```
