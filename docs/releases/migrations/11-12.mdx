title: "1.1 ➡️ 1.2"
description: Workspace edition 1.2 brings new features, improvements to the SDF CLI, and a major cleanup of the workspace configuration file. This guide will help you migrate your workspace from edition 1.1 to 1.2.

## Breaking Changes

### New Defaults

Previously, defaults like schema and catalog were set at the workspace level or at the includes path level like so:

```yaml
workspace:
  ...
  dialect: snowflake
  preprocessor: all
  default-schema: public
  default-catalog: analytics
  includes:
    ...
    - path: models/raw/
      default-schema: raw-schema
      default-catalog: raw
```

Now, all defaults are set under a `defaults` block. The above configuration would now look like this:

```yaml
workspace:
  ...
  defaults:
    schema: public
    catalog: analytics
    dialect: snowflake
    preprocessor: all
  includes:
    ...
    - path: models/raw/
      defaults:
        schema: raw-schema
        catalog: raw
```

<Note>
The `dialect` and `preprocessor` properties, which were previously set at the workspace level, should now be set under `defaults` as well.
</Note>

For a full list of new defaults available, see the [YML reference](/reference/sdf-yml#nested-element-defaults) 

### New Authentication Paradigm

SDF YML now supports a [Credential Block](/reference/sdf-yml#block-credential). This block is used to define credentials for various providers and various compute platforms. 

Just like before, you'll still be able to authenticate to your compute provider with the `sdf auth login <provider>` command, however now a credential SDF YML block will be created upon successful login. This will
store the credentials in `~/.sdf/credentials/`. By default, they will be stored in a file named `<provider>-default.sdf.yml`. However, `sdf auth login <provider>` now support a `name` parameter which will allow you to name the credential file. This
will become important for referencing the credential from provider blocks (see below).

**Due to this update, you will need to re-authenticate to your compute provider after upgrading to 1.2.**

* If on Redshift, follow the steps [here](/integrations/aws/redshift)


### New Provider Configuration

Providers are now more powerful than ever! With new features like systematic renaming per source and the ability to use different credentials for different providers, the provider configuration has undergone a serious upgrade.

The provider block now supports a `credential` field which allows you to specify which credential to use for a given provider. After logging in with the command above, you can reference the credential by name in the provider block. If you logged in above and did not pass a name,
the credential will be named `<provider>-default` and it will be used by default in the provider block if the provider's type (i.e. snowflake, redshift, etc.) matches the credential's type. 

In terms of breaking changes, the provider configuration is now a sub property of the workspace block. Previously, it was a top level property. 

If you have a provider block like this:
```yaml
provider:
  type: snowflake
  sources: 
    - apress
```

Assuming the credential this provider requires was created without a name, it should now look like this:
```yaml
workspace:
  ...
  providers:
    - type: snowflake
      sources: 
        - pattern: apress.*.*
```

If you gave the credential a name, let's say `snowflake-creds`, it should look like this:
```yaml
workspace:
  ...
  providers:
    - type: snowflake
      credential: snowflake-creds
      sources: 
        - pattern: apress.*.*
```

<Warning>
  Specifying the database name alone **no longer works** as shorthand. In order to fetch all schemas and tables from a database, you must use the wildcard syntax `<database-name>.*.*`.
</Warning>

### Goodbye Code Contracts and Code Reports

In an effort to simplify our nomenclature, we've renamed `Code Contracts` to `Checks` and `Code Reports` to `Reports`. In terms of breaking changes, the `code-contracts` and `code-reports` include types have now been replaced with `checks` and `reports` respectively.

If you currently have a workspace with includes paths like so:
```yaml 
workspace:
  ...
  includes:
    ...
  - path: reports
    type: code-report
  - path: checks 
    type: code-contract
```

You'll now need to update your workspace to look like this:
```yaml
workspace:
  ...
  includes:
    ...
  - path: reports
    type: report
  - path: checks 
    type: check
```

### No More Seeds for Compilation

Since we now have the table providers, the schema for seeds will be hydrated by the provider, and does not need to be inferred from the data by SDF.

If you currently have seeds in your workspace like so:
```yaml
---
table:
  name: apress.public.raw_customers
  location: seeds/raw_customers.csv
  file-format: csv
  with-header: true

---
table:
  name: apress.public.raw_orderitems
  location: seeds/raw_orderitems.csv
  file-format: csv
  with-header: true

---
table:
  name: apress.public.raw_orders
  location: seeds/raw_orders.csv
  file-format: csv
  with-header: true
```

You can remove them as long as the database they are materialized to is included in one of your provider blocks.

<Warning>
  SDF improved its type inference for data directly, and this creates some discrepancies between compute types in Snowflake, Redshift, and locally inferred. If you have a seed that is not being hydrated by the provider, you can add it back to the workspace as a table, but it may run into type coercion errors in rare cases. 
  As such, we recommend pulling schemas for seeds directly from the provider for static use cases.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  `sdf seed` is coming soon which will enable you to materialize data locally as a seed in your remote compute provider.
