We released another version of the CLI which contains many updates, bug fixes, and other improvements to SDF.

### What's New?

- Cleaned up and added a few more common xtasks:
    - `cargo xtask test-all` -- run all tests in parallel from any subdir
    - `cargo xtask goldie-update` -- likewise but update golden files
    - `cargo xtask build` -- codegen then build
    - `cargo xtask sync-binders` -- sync common binder code
- Introduced support for `unnest` and `unnest_in_where` as a relation alias 
- Added support for table wildcard in back tilt. Ex: `select * from dataset.table*`
- Added early-stage depth analysis 
- Added tests for duplicate fields
- General bug fixes and stability improvements
