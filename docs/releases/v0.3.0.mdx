### June 24th, 2024

We are excited to announce that a new minor release of our CLI is now available, bringing
 improvements, new features, and bug fixes to SDF. Interested in our product roadmap or want to 
discuss features? Reach out to your SDF point of contact to provide any points of feedback!

### Migrate from version 1.2 to 1.3

Workspace edition 1.3 brings a new information schema, improvements to the SDF CLI, and 
an expansion of what was previously the provider configuration. We've created a guide to help 
migrate your workspace from edition 1.2 to 1.3.

In versions 0.3.0 and above, workspace 1.3 is required. As a first step, please update your 
workspace block to the following and complete the steps within the [1.2 -> 1.3 Migration Guide](releases/migrations/12-13)

``` yml workspace.sdf.yml
workspace:
  edition: "1.3"
  ...
```

### New Trino/Presto Reference Functions 

SDF DB is currently designed to model Trino in semantics and execution. 
All functions are currently designed for 1:1 compatiblity with the functions 
in the Trino Dialect. Function implementation is in Rust, providing for fast execution.

Each supported function has a new doc outlining an example and supported signatures.

- [String Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/string-functions)
- [Math Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/array-functions)
- [Datetime Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/datetime-functions)
- [Aggregate Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/aggregate-functions)
- [Regexp Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/regexp-functions)
- [Comparison Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/comparison-functions)
- [Binary Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/binary-functions)
- [Conditional Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/conditional-functions)
- [Array Functions](/database/supported-functions/trino/array-functions)

### Add Support for S3 Output-Location

Introducing support for an `output-location` property on the SDF integration. This 
allows users to specify either a local path to output targets to a remote S3 path. 
Remote paths require corresponding data providers to be setup withint the 
`workspace.sdf.yml` file.

```yml workspace.sdf.yml
---
environment:
  name: test_output_location
  ...
  integrations:
    - provider: sdf
      output-location: "s3://sdf-cli-tests/remote-location-test/" # or local path ../../path-to-artifacts
    - provider: s3
      type: data
      credential: aws_integration
      buckets:
        - uri: s3://sdfdatasets
          region: us-east-1
```

### General bug fixes and stability improvements:
- Fix browser history back/forward bug
- Support schema evolution for snapshots
- Improve caching of SDF Lineage
- Fix bugs in snapshots and remote download handling
