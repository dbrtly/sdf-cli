### Migrating from v0.2.x to v0.3.x 

With the introduction of major changes such as the information schema, providers expanding to integrations, and changes to the `workspace.sdf.yml`, 
previous workspaces will encounter breaking changes when upgraded. If you have not migrataed yet, please reference this guide: [Migrating from v0.2.x to v0.3.x](/releases/migrations/12-13)

### Mom’s Flower Shop Walk Through

This tutorial series works through a single SDF workspace - “Mom’s Flower Shop”. In this page, we will provide a setup 
guide as well as an overview of this workspace. We will even use SDF to conduct some initial exploration.

### SDF DB in Alpha

Local execution with support for trino / presto syntax is up and running. The functions powering this execution have 
been open sourced and can be found [here](https://github.com/sdf-labs/sql-functions)

### .sdfcache is now sdftarget

 `.sdfcache` is now called `sdftarget` and is no longer hidden directory. Thanks for your feedback on this! 
 Remember to update your `.gitignore` and not commit the old `.sdfcache`.

functions in the Trino Dialect. Each function has a new example and supported signature.

environment blocks can be specified as `dev` and `prod` to be referenced by CLI commands 
such as `sdf compile -e dev`.

To learn more about setting up and managing environments, check out this doc about 
[SDF workspaces for sandbox, dev, staging, and production](/guide/setup/environments).
