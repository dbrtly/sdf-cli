title:"Ensuring Data Quality"
---

## Overview
In the previous tutorials we learned how SDF can help enforce metadata-based data 
contracts, which are defined against SDF's [information schema](/reference/sdf-information-schema).

In this tutorial, we will add tests against the data in our warehouse, creating an
additional layer of data quality validation throughout the data warehouse.

SDF Provides a standard and open-source [testing library](https://github.com/sdf-labs/tests). 
The functions provided in the library are included natively in SDF.

<Tip>
  All SDF Tests for all columns are compiled into table scans. 
  This allows SDF to run multiple tests with a single scan. 
  This dramatically reduces the cost of data tests.

<Steps>
    <Step title="What Are SDF Tests?">
        There are three types of builtin tests.
        - **Scalar Column Tests** - validate expectations of individual values in columns (eg. `x > 100` )
        - **Aggregate Column Tests** - validate expectations of all values in a columns (eg. `sum(x) > 100` )
        - **Table Tests** - validate expectations for all columns in table (eg. columns a and b are unique).

        In this tutorial, we will create one test of each type. 

        <Tip>
            To learn more about SDF's testing capabilities, read our 
            [Tests Guide](/guide/data-quality/tests).
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup">
        Since SDF's tests library leverages Jinja, we also need to add Jinja as a preprocessor.
        In the `workspace.sdf.yml` file, uncomment the following:

        ``` yml workspace.sdf.yml
        # Uncomment here to begin the "Ensuring Data Quality" tutorial >>>>>>
        defaults: 
          preprocessor: jinja
        # <<<<<<
        ```
        
        For the sake of this tutorial, we will add tests on the `inapp_events` staging model located in 
        `models/staging/inapp_events`.
        
        To add tests to the model, we need to create a YML file to hold the model's metadata.

        Under `metadata/staging`, create a new file called `inapp_events.sdf.yml` containing the following definition:

        ``` yml metadata/staging/inapp_events.sdf.yml
        table:
            name: inapp_events
        ```
        
        <Tip>
            In this tutorial, we use the metadata file to define tests, but we've seen in past tutorials
            how the table metadata file is also used for table and column descriptions and classifications' 
            application.
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Scalar Column Tests">
    Let's say we want to verify there are no negative orders, meaning the event_value which represents the 
    total order amount in USD.

    We can use the scalar test `valid_scalar(condition)` where `condition = event_value >=0`. 
    Add to the newly created YML file the following test:

    ``` yml metadata/staging/inapp_events.sdf.yml
    table:
        name: inapp_events
        # Add the code below:
        columns: 
          - name: event_value
            tests:
              - expect: valid_scalar("""event_value >= 0""")
                severity: error
    ```

    A few things to note:
        1. This is a column-level test so we need to add a column definition
        2. To specify the condition, we need to wrap it with triple quotes `"""condition"""`
        3. We can define a severity level for the test - either error or warning
    
    To execute the test, simply run the command:
    ``` shell
    sdf test --show result
    ```


<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
[Pass]&nbsp;Test&nbsp;moms_flower_shop.staging.test_inapp_events

</code>
</pre>
</div>
    
    </Step>
    <Step title="Aggregate Column Tests">
        We can write a similar test as an aggregate column test. Instead of validating 
        each value individually, we can just look at the minimum value of `event_value` 
        and assert whether it is positive.

        Let's add the new test to the YML file:

        ``` yml metadata/staging/inapp_events.sdf.yml
        table:
          name: inapp_events
          columns: 
              - name: event_value
                tests:
                  - expect: valid_scalar("""event_value >= 0""")
                    severity: error
                  # Add the code below:
                  - expect: minimum(0)
                    severity: error
        ```

        <Tip>
            All types of tests work together harmoniously and will be executed within 
            one table scan to save on compute costs. 
        </Tip>

        Let's run the test again:
        ``` shell
        sdf test --show result
        ```


<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-shell'>
<code className='language-shell'>
[Pass]&nbsp;Test&nbsp;moms_flower_shop.staging.test_inapp_events

</code>
</pre>
</div>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Table Tests">
        On a table level, we want to make sure that our unique key is indeed unique.
        In this case, the table key is event_id. However, in other cases, it could be
        a combination of multiple columns. SDF supports all scenarios.

        Let's add this table-level test to the YML file:

        ``` yml metadata/staging/inapp_events.sdf.yml
        table:
            name: inapp_events
            # Add the code below:
            tests:
              - expect: unique_columns(["event_id"])
                severity: error
            columns: 
                - name: event_value
                    tests:
                        ...
        ```

        <Note>
        Notice we wrap the column name with quotation marks `"col_name"`.
        </Note>

        We can run the tests again:
        ``` shell
        sdf test --show result
        ```


<div className="bg-[#0F1117] dark:bg-codeblock rounded-xl dark:ring-1 dark:ring-gray-800/50 relative">
<pre style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} className='language-error'>
<code className='language-error'>
[Pass]&nbsp;Test&nbsp;moms_flower_shop.staging.test_inapp_events

</code>
</pre>
</div>
    </Step>

## Summary
Quality tests against your data are critical to ensure that the data is correct 
and meets the expectations of data consumers.

SDF's built-in open-source tests lib makes it super easy to add rule-based 
data quality checks to your data warehouse.
